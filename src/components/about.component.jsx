            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Passionate about always trying to better myself, I embrace any challenges that come my way. 
                As a life long learner, I enjoy taking on new projects that expand my knowledge on a particular subject, whether that be software engineering, 
                data engineering, or data science. One of my favorite passtimes is playing the guitar, as I regulary like to jam with friends. 
                I also enjoy brushing up on my math skills as it scratches the puzzle itch I have. 
                Eventually, I would love to get into game development as a programming hobby.
